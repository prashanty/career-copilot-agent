"""The Job Scout job-finding graph.

The graph takes an already-extracted ``Profile`` as input (extraction is a
separate step — see ``job_scout.profile``) and focuses on finding jobs:

    START -> fetch_jobs -> rank_jobs -> [should_reformulate]
                ^                              |
                └──── reformulate_query ◄──────┘
                                               |
                                              END

The conditional edge after ranking is what makes this an agent rather than a
straight-line workflow: if too few strong matches came back, it loops through
``reformulate_query`` to broaden the search — capped at 2 reformulations.

One compiled graph serves the whole project. Phase 2 adds a conditional entry
router (``selected_job_id`` → a ``tailor`` node) that reads ``profile`` and
``ranked_jobs`` from the checkpointed thread; the search pipeline below does not
change.
