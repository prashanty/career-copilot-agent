## 📖 About This Project

**Job Scout** is a real, observable AI agent you run on your own machine. Upload
your CV and it extracts a structured profile, searches real job openings, and
ranks each with a **fit score (0–100)** plus an honest explanation of the match
and the gaps. Every LLM and tool call is traced in
[Opik](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/) from the very first run.

It is the first entry in *The Observable Job Agent*, a series that builds one
agent while building the ability to see inside it: **Build → Evaluate →
Self-Improve**.

> **🎯 The observability difference:** most tutorials add telemetry at the end.
> We don't. The agent gets instrumented *before* it gets good, so cost, latency,
> and quality are measurable from run one. The whole series builds on that
> decision.

> **The human applies. The agent never submits applications.** The bottleneck in
> a job hunt is the research and tailoring per application, not clicking submit.
> That is the part worth automating.

### 🧭 What You'll Build

- **End-to-end agent:** CV (PDF) → typed profile → LLM-driven job search → batched fit ranking → a bounded reformulation loop
- **LLM-driven tool use:** the model chooses the search arguments; your code executes them, and you can watch it choose in the trace
- **Full Opik tracing on every run:** a span tree per node, an auto-drawn agent graph, per-run cost, the CV attached to the trace, and versioned prompts — all from one line of code
- **A Gradio interface** with streamed progress and a run footer (cost, latency, deep link to the trace)
- **Multi-source job search** (JSearch, Adzuna, Remotive, offline cache) that runs with **zero API keys**
- **An honest baseline**: run it at scale, measure everything, document the weaknesses ([`docs/phase1_findings.md`](docs/phase1_findings.md)), and resist fixing them too early


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)** package manager
- API keys are **optional** — the app runs with none.

### ⚡ Get Started

```bash
# 1. Clone this part's release
git clone //will get add in future
cd observable-job-agent

# 2. Install
uv sync --all-groups

# 3. Configure (all keys optional)
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Verify (no network, no credits)
make test

# 5. Launch the app, then upload a CV from data/fixture_cvs/
make app
```

**Runs with zero keys** via Remotive + a committed offline cache. Add keys when
you want live international jobs, real ranking, and tracing. Every key has a free
path — see [`docs/opik_setup.md`](docs/opik_setup.md).

**Default model** is `openai:gpt-4o-mini`. Swap it with one env var: `SCOUT_MODEL`
(e.g. `groq:llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for free, or `ollama:llama3.2` for local).
Free models correctly show $0.00 cost in Opik.

### 📊 Access Points

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **Gradio UI** | http://localhost:7860 | Upload a CV, review the profile, find ranked jobs |
| **Opik dashboard** | your Comet project | Span tree, agent graph, per-run cost, prompt library |

## 🏗️ Architecture

CV extraction is a preprocessing step (`job_scout.profile`) that produces a typed
`Profile`; the graph takes that profile and focuses on finding jobs:

```
extract_profile(cv) → Profile ─┐
                               ▼
     START → fetch_jobs → rank_jobs → [enough good matches?]
                ↑                            │ no
                └──── reformulate_query ◄────┘   │ yes → END
```

- **`fetch_jobs`** is an LLM tool-calling node: the model *chooses* the `search_jobs` arguments (query, country, remote).
- **`rank_jobs`** scores postings in batches of 5, one structured-output call per batch, capped at 25 jobs.
- **`reformulate_query`** broadens the search if fewer than 5 jobs score ≥ 60, bounded to at most 2 loops. That conditional edge is what makes this an agent rather than a straight-line workflow.

The search fans out over **JSearch** (primary, city-level), **Adzuna**
(international), **Remotive** (keyless remote), and a **committed offline cache**.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **No jobs / all `source: cache`** — you have no live-source keys, or the network is blocked. Expected; the cache is the offline fallback. Add Adzuna/JSearch keys and re-run `make snapshot`.
- **Cost shows $0.00** — you're on a free model (Groq/Ollama). Opik prices only OpenAI/Anthropic/Google models.
- **No traces in Opik** — check `OPIK_ENABLED=true` and that `OPIK_API_KEY` / `OPIK_WORKSPACE` are set. See [`docs/opik_setup.md`](docs/opik_setup.md).

## 💰 Cost

Reproducing everything in Part 1 costs **under $0.50** with API models, or is
**fully free** with local models (Ollama) or free tiers. The app runs with zero
keys via Remotive + the offline cache.
